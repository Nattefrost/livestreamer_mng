#### HOW TO USE ####
####################

Open file 'streams.txt', copy-paste urls from your favourite streamers. This file should not contain ANYTHING ELSE than urls.
So a line in this file should look like this (dont forget 'http://'): http://streamingWebsite.com/channelName
If a stream can't be read, refer to the Livestreamer doc about supported platforms : 
						http://docs.livestreamer.io/plugin_matrix.html

When you have made up your list of favourite streams, execute start.bat (start.sh on GNU/Linux or the desktop shortcut on Microsoft Windows)
You should see a window with a list of urls you entered in 'streams.txt' only those which are online should be there.
Select the one you want to watch, double-click or press RETURN and enjoy your stream. =)
